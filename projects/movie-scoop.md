date: "2021-08-15"
summary: "This application is for movie lovers who want to provide their take on their favorite movies. With the wide use of Rotten Tomatoes and other review aggregators, we wanted to build a more user focused experience that would be removed from the mainstream movie critic consensus."
features: "This app allows users to create an account, search for movies, and post their own reviews. Users can see reviews left by fellow users, and have access to their review history in their account page."
role: "For this project my responsibilities included: project management, front-end development, back-end development and app deployment."
